I've re-designed [my personal site][1] recently since the old version had too much description words, which is not the best design I could offer as a Web Front-End Designer :smirk:. You may probably find some interesting features at this site (and especially the [home page][1]), so this post is expected to explain how to implement them.

# What to achieve?

## Shadow responding to mouse move
